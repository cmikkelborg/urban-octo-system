This is a mouse click automation tool. It is my first app!
### -Features-
- GUI w/ threaded callbacks
- adjustable delay between clicks
- left or right mouse button
- single or double clicks
- repeat set number of times or until stopped
- shortcut keys to start and pause automation while in background
- 5 second delayed start

### Notes

F1 to start and F3 to stop. I understand this is not ideal for all situations, however it was created to suit a specific need of mine that does not have other functions bound to those keys. Will look into a multi key press shortcut in feature.
